        <h1>Chicken</h1>

        <p>
          The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated
          junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey
          and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern
          Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger
          male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a
          capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature
          female is called a pullet.
